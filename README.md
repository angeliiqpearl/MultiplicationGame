# MultiplicationGame

Multiplication is one of the key operations of mathematics. Having a good understanding of the basic rules of it, will help in solving more complex mathematical problems. We see the application of multiplication in our day to day lives, examples include recognising patterns and for-loops.

The curriculum can be overwhelming at times, leading to not enough time being spent on basics and learners not getting enough practice. The code will assist them in grasping the concept of multiplication. Memorising the multiplication table is not sufficient, hence the code works by generating random values to challenge the users.

This is how it works:
-The program will allow the user to insert a number, that would represent the number of problems they would like to receive and solve.
-After each attempt, the user will get a response on whether the answer was correct or not. 
-At the end of the session, a percentage will be given depicting the number of correct answers from that session. 
-A time lapse of that session will be provided as well. In this way the focus is on the improvement of speed and accuracy.
